                amazing things.</p>

            <p>Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version of Live in 2001.  Our products are used by 
                a community of dedicated musicians, sound designers, and artists from across the world.

            </p>

            <p>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion 
                 for what we make, and the people we make it for.

                our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.</p>

            <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We 
                come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are 
                self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that 
                each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future 
                of music culture.</p>

            <p>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their 
                magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are 
                richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always 
                agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

                 strive to create a wealth of opportunities to learn from and with each other.</p>

            <p>Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge
